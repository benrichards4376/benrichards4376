I'm learning computer science at UCF and am making project folders for all my classes to show what I am learning and how I am growing. I have intermediate experience
with both C and Java, and some very basic experience with LateX.
These projects are the finished product of assignments from my current classes, and I will be updating each repository as my experience continues.
When I get more free time I might add a separate repository for personal projects.

Why Computer Science?:
What sparked my wanting to learn about programming is my deep love for video games. Growing up, I would spend hours and hours into flash games, and when I
could afford a console, higher-budget games, with a few of my favorites being Skyrim, Undertale, and The Legend of Zelda Series. I've always been intrigued by how
games were put together, but never had any understanding of actual code. Once I started to learn code, I learned that I had a passion for programming as well, as
the problem-solving and real-life application aspects really feel fun and rewarding, even if overwhelmingly frustrating at times. The more I learn the more I want
to keep learning, and I hope to pursue this career field for that reason.

Other Interests:
Outside of Computer Science I am deeply interested in music and theatre. I was in many theatre performances and various choral concerts in high school, playing
in both lead and ensemble roles, all of which helped me grow into the person I am today. I have been singing since I was a kid, and playing piano as a hobby since
high school. I love learning new things in any subject; one of my favorite pastimes is going down a Wikipedia rabbit trail, or watching an interesting YouTube 
video because it's common to stumble onto something incredible, and you leave having learned something very few peopl have the care to learn about.


If you've read this far, I hope you enjoy my projects. They're not supposed to be some expert craftsman level of code, rather a documentation of my personal
journey into a field I had zero experience coming in with but now love enough to work in for the rest of my life.

Thank you for your time :)
